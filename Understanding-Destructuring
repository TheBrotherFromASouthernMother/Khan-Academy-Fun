Destructuring allows the developer to take a part the properties of an object or the values of a array and declare them as
individual variables in the global scope.

//Object containing properties
let arr = {
  a: "Animals", 
  b: "Get your damn dirty Ape hands off me",
  c: "I like big booty",
  d: 12}; 
  
//declartion of properties as individual variables
let {a, b, c, d} = arr;
  --OJO: When destructing an object's properties, the variable names must match the keys in the object, this is not necessary
    for arrays.


//logs the new variables out to the console
console.log(a);
console.log(b);
console.log(c);
console.log(d);
